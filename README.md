<h1 align="center">Hello friends! My name is Ajay.  üëã</h1>

## üë®üèæ‚Äçüíª About Me:

üéì I am a junior at **UNC-Chapel Hill**, majoring in **Computer Science** and **Information Science** and minoring in *Data Science*. I am actively seeking iOS development and full-stack development internship opportunities.

üå± I am passionate about using software to create mobile and web experiences that impact real people. I am also passionate about implementing thoughtful designs and visualizations to make these experiences more meaningful and impactful.

üì± I am experienced in leveraging Swift and SwiftUI using Xcode to develop iOS, iPadOS, and watchOS applications. I served as an iOS developer for Bubbly, an app designed to improve the condition of kids with CVI (cortical vision impairment), the #1 vision impairment diagnosis in the US, with researchers from the University of Northern Colorado and Harvard Medical School. Throughout high school, I developed two apps, Geogsmart and PocketChem, currently available for free on the iOS App Store, for which I post updates periodically. I continue to work on iOS app projects to release to the iOS App Store.

üíª I am also comfortable with developing full-stack web applications. I have designed, developed, and deployed projects using TypeScript, Next.js, React, and Angular. I also have practice with server-side development using Python and Node and developing APIs. I have also worked collaboratively in environments employing agile methodologies and utilizing Git / GitHub version control.

üîç I am the President of Carolina Analytics and Data Science @ UNC. Our organization aims to teach and promote data science on campus. I am also comfortable working with numerous data engineering and analysis tools, especially with Python.

üé• I am a content creator and run my own YouTube channel, where I post videos relating to school, coding, and tech. As a student, I hope to use my platform to inspire other young people to code, pursue their passions, and be excited about learning and creating new things. 

ü§† In my free time, I enjoy learning about languages and linguistics. At UNC, I have taken three levels of Japanese and am currently learning Mandarin! I also enjoy cooking, traveling, and learning more about the world in which we live.

ü§© I am passionate about technology, learning, solving problems, and sharing my experiences with others. I eagerly welcome opportunities to connect with others who want to learn more and whom I can learn from!
