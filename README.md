## 👨🏾‍💻 About Me:

Hello friends! My name is Ajay, and I a graduate student at the Department of Computer Science at UNC-Chapel Hill. I serve as the instructor of [COMP 426: Modern Web Programming](https://comp426-25s.github.io/) at UNC-Chapel Hill. I am also an iOS/macOS developer and have developed four apps for the App Store. I also am a full-stack software engineer for the Computer Science Experience Labs (CSXL) at UNC.

🍎 I am passionate about computer science education, and developing pedagogical methods to increase engagement, passion, equity, and inclusiveness in computing! I am also interested in how computers and software can have this same effect in the classroom and enhance student learning and productivity, promote curiosity about new topics, and reach those previously excluded from quality education.

🎨 I am also passionate about design! I believe that well-designed apps and software makes the user experience more meaningful and impactful, furthering the mission and goals of the app. I am interested in learning more about human-computer interaction and how design choices affect how people use apps, increase accessibility to allow more people to use the app, and what people think about the software they interact with every day.

🌱 Lastly, I believe that as computer scientists and software engineers, we have a responsibility to use our knowledge and skills in a way that is ethical, thoughtful, and improves the human condition through social good. I am interested in the ethics of computing, as well making mobile and web apps that help real people!

🀄 In my free time, I enjoy learning about languages and linguistics. I also enjoy cooking, traveling, and learning more about the world in which we live.

\- Ajay

### Luduan for iOS - Chinese Language Learning App
![Swift](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Swift-05122A?style=flat&logo=swift)
![SwiftUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SwiftUI-05122A?style=flat&logo=swift&logoColor=03c3ff)
![SwiftData](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SwiftData-05122A?style=flat&logo=swift&logoColor=808080)
![CloudKit](https://img.shields.io/badge/-CloudKit-05122A?style=flat&logo=icloud&logoColor=03c3ff)

Luduan is the ultimate, all-in-one companion app for students learning Chinese. Luduan makes it easy to study vocabulary, practice mastery, look up words and Chinese characters, and learn more about the Chinese language. 

Users can create **customized study sets** to learn and categorize new vocabulary, and **organize study sets** in folders to group related sets, create and filter words by **tags** to group related vocabulary, play customizable **flashcard games** to improve your mastery of vocabulary, and improve their Chinese handwriting with a **handwriting practice** game. Luduan also keeps track of users' learning progress, providing **analytics** on commonly-missed words. Users can also learn more about the over 120,000 Chinese words in Luduan’s Word Dictionary, including information about alternate pronunciations, definitions, and associated measure words - as well as the over 9,000 Chinese Hanzi characters. Luduan's Hanzi Catalog includes animated stroke order diagrams and information on Hanzi radicals and components. Luduan also includes many reference tools, including an interactive Pinyin and Tones guide, bundled with customizable practice games to improve users' listening skills.


Luduan is written purely in **Swift** and **SwiftUI** using the *MV architecture*. The app is *modularized*, separating business logic for the data layer, as well as commonly shared UI elements, into separate packages imported by the final project. Luduan utilizes **[SwiftData](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftdata/)** with *[CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/cloudkit/)* to seamlessly and automatically persist user information, study sets, and settings in realtime in the cloud across devices.

Luduan was first released in 2024 and remains in active development!

### PocketChem for iOS - Periodic Table with Chemistry Calculators and Reference Tools

![SwiftUI](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SwiftUI-05122A?style=flat&logo=swift&logoColor=03c3ff)

PocketChem is a portable and easy-to-use elegant periodic table, chemistry calculator, and chemistry reference app for iOS devices. PocketChem also has many calculators, including a **chemical equation balancer**, **significant figure calculator**, **empirical formula solver**, and **molecular formula solver**. The app also has a reference guide with many useful chemistry facts and formulas.

PocketChem is written purely in **Swift** and **SwiftUI** using the *MV architecture*. The app is *modularized* and utilizes the new **Swift Testing** framework for unit testing and *SwiftLint* for consistent code organization. Learn more by checking out the GitHub repo below!

PocketChem was first released in 2020 when I was in high school. The original version of PocketChem utilized UIKit. In 2024, I rewrote PocketChem in SwiftUI using the many software development skills I have learned in college and through working on other projects. PocketChem remains in active development!

PocketChem is also **available to view on GitHub!** The README includes more details on the app, its architecture, and some of the technical components of its features. Check it out below!

![UIKit](https://img.shields.io/badge/-UIKit-05122A?style=flat&logo=swift&logoColor=03c3ff)

Geogsmart aims to make learning geography more fun, rewarding, and engaging with XP and mastery, an in-game store to buy new app icons, leaderboards to conquer, and badges to collect!

Geogsmart was written in **Swift** and **UIKit**. Geogsmart was released in 2019 and is the first iOS app I ever worked on and released in high school! Working on Geogsmart was an extremely tough but rewarding process at the time and solidified by passion for app development. I plan on revisiting Geogsmart with a big update soon!
